Kalah Gameboard is a software that implements an ancient board game called
Kalah or Mancala.

From Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalah):
    
    The game requires a Kalah board and 36 - 72 seeds or stones. The board has 
    six small pits, called houses, on each side; and a big pit, called a Kalah 
    or store, at each end. 
    The object of the game is to capture more seeds than one's opponent.
    
    Rules.
    1. At the beginning of the game, three seeds are placed in each house.
    2. Each player controls the six houses and their seeds on his/her side of 
    the board. His/her score is the number of seeds in the store to his/her 
    right.
    3. Players take turns sowing their seeds. On a turn, the player removes 
    all seeds from one of the houses under his/her control. Moving 
    counter-clockwise, the player drops one seed in each house in turn, 
    including the player's own store but not his/her opponent's.
    4. If the last sown seed lands in the player's store, the player gets 
    an additional move. There is no limit on the number of moves a player can 
    make in his/her turn.
    5. If the last sown seed lands in an empty house owned by the player, and 
    the opposite house contains seeds, both the last seed and the opposite 
    seeds are captured and placed into the player's store.
    6. When one player no longer has any seeds in any of his/her houses, 
    the game ends. The other player moves all remaining seeds to his/her store, 
    and the player with the most seeds in his/her store wins.
    
    The game may vary with amount of initial seeds: 3, 4, 5, 6. The more seeds
    the more harder to play.

Tips of how to create your own gameplay method.

    To create your own search method that plays Kalah you should 
    create a method class that inherited from the Method class 
    (methods/method.py). You should place a new method's file to the methods
    folder. When you finished creating your method it will be accessible in the 
    Kalah options dialog window. For more details please check examples in 
    methods/random.py and methods/minmax.py

Tips of how to create your own minimax heuristic method.

    Just take methods/minmax.py file and carefully read the comments and 
    explanations. You will find there that you should simply rewrite only
    two functions (_utility and _terminal_test) to create your own
    minimax heuristic method.
    
Project structure

    images - images folder
    methods - package for all gameplay methods
    methods/__init__.py - package init file (does nothing)
    methods/method.py - module with most abstract method class called Method
    methods/minmax.py - implementation of minimax heuristic algorithm
    methods/random.py - implementation of random dummy algorithm
    methods/state.py - module with State class for Kalah game; check it - there
                        are all Kalah's gaming rules are implemented (loof up
                        to make_move function)
    main.py - main project module; run it to work with Kalah Gameboard
    main_window.py - main window module of the Kalah Gameboard
    main_window.ui - QtDesigner file for the main window
    options_dialog.py - dialog window for main options of the Kalah Gameboard
    options_dialog.ui - dialog window for main options QtDesigner
    student_gamer.py - use this to run Kalah games between AIs in console

Prerequisites
    
    You will need to install PyQt5 (https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) to have the Kalah project work properly.

How to run

    Use main.py to play Kalah with GUI. You may play in different modes: human/human, human/AI, AI/AI.

    Use student_gamer.py to run single games or tournament games between different AIs. The results will be 
    posted to the game_logs directory and to the results.txt log file.
